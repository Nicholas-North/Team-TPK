Agenda for today:
- Find a suitable response to Gallagher's raised objections of how true will our model be.

Notes:
Instead of difficulty, maybe have roles? Playstyle instead of role for ease of naming convention
- Focus on DPS, Crowd Control, Healing & Buffs, Tank
- Slider from 0-1 for each category
- Creating a survey with options for each class in a series of scenarios, where the options are weighted towards certain roles
- DM will also be able to move the slider
- n = 25~40 for sample size
- Reach out to all our local friends and their groups for the survey
- Reach out to the D&D club as well
- Will need to be careful because some of the terms set here aren't clearly defined

Run a monte carlo simulation of every possible simulation they could do
- Perhaps a no-weighted simulation?
- Visualization for turn by turn simulations; i.e. iterations

How would this monte carlo simulation work with the weights?
-Input is always going to be random values. What are those random values? Perhaps the dice roll of saves, attacks, etc.
-Slider would be for what those sliders are for
-Output is going to be what? The odds of Total Win, Win, Total Loss, Loss
-Will need to run a monte carlo for each simulation?
-The monte carlo will not be for which actions are taken. A simpler method will likely work better for the action choice
-THe monte carlo will be for the individual entities

What's the complexity
Potentially simplifying the situation by taking average intiative, having ties be broken by dex value, those ties being favored to PC's, Ties between PC's being deferred to some other metric

Brandon's New Solution
- Are data's in a database
- Behind what's shown to the DM's, there will be a spreadsheet that takes in the data and then fills out more metrics.
- Will probably need a different simulation for choosing the action set
- Then have a monte carlo simulation go off after that
- Update learning weights after each turn
- We may need to dumb it down
- Filtering down actions to: martial single target melee, martial single target ranged, magical single target melee, magical single target ranged, magical single target aoe, buff
- Break it into three parts: Charaction action, round action, combat as a whole. Battlefield data -> Character Model -> Runs multiple simulations for possible CM action -> Battlefield Data after CM action -> Next character -> ....
