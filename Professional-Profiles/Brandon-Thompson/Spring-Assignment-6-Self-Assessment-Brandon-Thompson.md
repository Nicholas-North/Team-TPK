Part A:

For this project we all decided early on to pick one of the three domains of our design and focus on it. First the whole first semester and the majority of this spring I have chosen to focus on the python code that runs with our batch processor. The base functionality of our code and what I would call the skeleton were my main goals at first. Later on this semester we all jumped into help in other areas. Sam helped flesh out the code while I moved to improve the visuals and functionality of our website. 

I would say we definitely built upon our skills that we identified early on. I have become even more confident in my python coding as well as my front end work. I had worked very little on websites in the past so picking up those skills was even more noticeable for me. Some of my biggest accomplishments included running the simulation for the first time, seeing the finished website with all of the working pieces, and implementing movement for the simulation. As for obstacles, figuring out the batch process as well as the map communicating with the database were some of the most notable. 


Part B:

Our group was able to get a three part project working seamlessly, each with impressive work to show. As for group work, I realized how important it was to have additional eyes looking at code, as the jump in progress was amazing after we started to share roles rather than each stick to ourselves. I think we were especially successful when it came to communication. This project had some of the best communication I have ever experienced between teammates. I cannot think of what I would consider a weakness except for maybe our combined procrastination, but we were able to identify that issue and work it out well.  

I would say that we all had comparable efforts on this project. Seeing as we all worked on one part solely at first and then we all hopped to help in other areas by the end. I think they both deserve recognition for their efforts. Sam helped really make the python special and bring it to a much better place than I initially had it. Nick really put in so much effort in the final sprint before expo and I really found it admirable how much time he was able to give.
