### Projects Sought
- I'm interested specifically in the fields of Data Science, Statistics, and Analytics, so I would like to be involved in a project with a focus in those fields. However, I am open to all types of projects. For me, the goal is to create something with a real world application. For example, even though I think game development is an engaging idea, it's not the type of project I would prefer for my capstone. I realize this is incredibly nonspecific, but that's because I'm open to most project ideas, and I'm excited to ideate with my group partner to create a project we're both proud of!
