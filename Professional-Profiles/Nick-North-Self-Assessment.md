# Self Assessment
  For my, and by extension; team TPK’s senior design project, we have decided to make an
application that allows dungeon masters for the D&D 5e RPG system to playtest their
combat encounters. The main goal of this being so that they can assess whether a fight is
too easy or hard; and so that they may adjust accordingly. D&D is by it’s nature a very
creative game though, and has a wide range of choices a single player character can make
during a turn, not to mention an entire group of player character’s. To facilitate being able
to properly trial run these encounters then requires the use of some sort of AI to help take
the place of the players. I believe that this will be a good opportunity for our team to focus
on machine learning skills to help the AI dynamically adjust to each team composition, as
well as work on front end development skills with the building from scratch of a user
interface.

  This focus that we find ourselves delving into lends itself quite nicely to the curriculum I’ve
set forth for my fall semester of senior year. With being able to choose my own electives, I
wanted to branch out into topics I haven’t had the opportunity to look into before hand;
specifically a deeper dive into AI and the development of user interfaces. To this end, I
decided to take Intelligent Data Analysis (5152), and User Interface (5167) to help broaden
my skill set. I think of most interest to me is User Interface, as a lot of my education up to
this point has dealt with more conceptual or backend computer science principles like
data structures or database analysis. My goal this semester is to go out of my comfort zone
and hopefully take charge on this project in creating something that not only is easy to use
for new-users, but something that showcases my ability to create front-end applications

  While I’m leaning on my education for the experience and knowledge necessary to do
front-end development; I’ll be leaning heavily on my skills I’ve honed at my Co-Op
experience for the AI training and data analysis that will be the cornerstone of this project.
Throughout my multiple Co-Op rotations, I’ve had extensive work dealing with SQL
databases and writing my own stored procedures/queries. These skills I believe will give
me a leg up when tackling the training of our data model; as for there to be proper training
to take place, there must be a large vault of data to pull from and to create ourselves. 

  All in all, I’m quite excited to begin work with Sam and Brandon on this endeavor, as one of
the things I believe I missed most during both school and work is the collaborative spirit
one shares when working together towards a common goal. Up to this point a lot of our
projects/assignments/tasks have been individual in nature, and while it teaches important
skills of self-reliance; it’s also hard to get a good grasp of other perspectives or approaches
when approaching problems. Although I think we would have fun either way with our
project, considering our group’s shared passion for the subject material at hand. We all
play D&D in our own time and have found ourselves wishing for a tool like the one we aim
to make at one point or another. So I believe that the project being about a shared passion
will bring a lot of enthusiasm and interest in going the extra mile.

  Just because it’s fun though doesn’t mean it’ll be easy. Our team envisions that we will
have a lot of ground to cover in order to accomplish such a lofty goal; and efforts are
already underway to figure out what all the steps are we need to take to do so. During our
team meeting, we discussed how we would need to limit our scope from all of the classes
in the game down to just a select few to start off with. Otherwise, we run the risk of feature
creep, and having a lot of half-finished examples rather than few incredibly polished ones.
Our hope is that by the end of our senior year, we will be able to provide at the expo a demo
that allows a user to create an account, plot a rough combat map of what they’ll fighting
on, and then put in the character sheets of their party to run through multiple combat
scenarios. Along with the intended user-facing interface, during this process we hope to
show glimpses into how all of the calculations are being made, and the various
models/runs the computer makes before getting to it’s final estimations.
