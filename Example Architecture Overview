Architecture Overview:

-We will be simulating the statistics and known values of the character through a character sheet structure
  - This will contain values like: Current HP, AC, To-Hit, Movement Speed, Weapons & Spells Available, Num Enemies, Num Allies, Their locations, etc.
-Amongst these values, will be the state vector which determines the actions that the player/NPC will take.
  - These values will be informed by the characteristics of that above. I.e: Current HP will be divided by total to determine the percentage of total HP. Enemy's locations will be compared to the movement distance of the player, to determine the true or false value
    of whether there's an enemy in range. So on and so forth
- These state vectors will then be ran against a list of templates containing production rules. These rules will be for what Action, Bonus Action, and Movement the player will take based on their current state vector's values. For instance, when to take the attack action,
  When to move away from an enemy, the like. These production rules will then change the state vector and characteristic's of both the player and all other creature's. For instance, if a creature goes down, it's friends value for allies unconsious or defeated should
  increment.
- This will go iteratively in terms of average initiative score, and will terminate once either one side is completely defeated or fled.

-Example of how to set up a duel between a pc and a monster.
  1.) Fill out the charactersitcs including health, ac, possible weapon attacks and spells that the two creatures can do.
  2.) Load each character with their respective list of production rule templates
  3.) Determine the values for the current state vector
  4.) Run the values of the current state vector for the following possible things a creature do during it's turn of combat: Movement, Action, Bonus Action
  5.) Find the matching template if any, or choose between multiple matching templates for each possible option
  6.) Implement the action/production rule of the matching template, than update the character sheet, and state vector of all creatures.
  7.) Go in order of Dex order until the round is over, than repeat going through rounds until the combat is concluded.
