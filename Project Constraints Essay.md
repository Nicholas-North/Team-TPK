The main project constraints we're facing with our project are economic, legal, and diversity and cultural limitations. For our economic constraints, there are many potential unaddressed costs. Our final project is a website, so there will be costs for the web domain and site address. There will also be server costs for the database we'll be implementing. We may also need to pay for software in order to properly develop our product. Next, there may be some legal limitations with our project. Because it is intrinsically tied to the Dungeons & Dragons brand, there could be some legal repercussions from Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro, the developers and owners of the IP. However, we don't foresee this happening. D&D has a deep history of open-use, "homebrewed" content for both game materials and software. Because of this past precent as well as the scope of our project, we don't believe we'll face any legal repercussions with the IP holders. Lastly, we may face some diversity and cultural limitations. We are designing our software with only English-speakers in mind. This is because none of us speak another language, so it will take away valuable development time for us to create multiple language versions of the website. This risks alienating non-English-speaking users.
