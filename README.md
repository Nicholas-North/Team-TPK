## Project Abstract

We aim to design an innovative web application tailored for Dungeons and Dragons game masters to assist with balancing combat encounters. This project will delve into the realms of web development, database design, and machine learning to create a robust tool that enhances the gaming experience by providing precise and dynamic combat simulations.

## [Project Description](Documentation/Project-Overview.md)

## User Stories

Story 1: As a person who runs a Dungeons and Dragons group, I want to see more information about combat encounters. This will help me plan my sessions easier and run my combats more smoothly. 

Story 2: As an adventure designer for commercial published material, I want to make sure the encounters I create are properly balanced and playtested to be at the set level the adventurer's are. 

Story 3: As a dungeon master, I want to be able to tweak existing monster stat blocks to make the fights more challenging, but also be able to know they aren't too stacked against the party's favor.

Story 4: As a D&D player, I want to engage in fun combat encounters and I wish there was a tool for my DM to make our current sessions more exciting.

Story 5: As a concerned parent, my child spends too much time designing complex dungeons and dragons encounters, I wish there was a tool to simplify the process, so that they can get their life back.

## ABET Concerns

The main project constraints we're facing with our project are economic, legal, and diversity and cultural limitations. For our economic constraints, there are many potential unaddressed costs. Our final project is a website, so there will be costs for the web domain and site address. There will also be server costs for the database we'll be implementing. We may also need to pay for software in order to properly develop our product. Next, there may be some legal limitations with our project. Because it is intrinsically tied to the Dungeons & Dragons brand, there could be some legal repercussions from Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro, the developers and owners of the IP. However, we don't foresee this happening. D&D has a deep history of open-use, "homebrewed" content for both game materials and software. Because of this past precent as well as the scope of our project, we don't believe we'll face any legal repercussions with the IP holders. Lastly, we may face some diversity and cultural limitations. We are designing our software with only English-speakers in mind. This is because none of us speak another language, so it will take away valuable development time for us to create multiple language versions of the website. This risks alienating non-English-speaking users.

## Budget

So far, we haven't had to use any money on this project as our student licenses have covered any IDE's or database set up such as for the SQL Server, but we envision that the hosting of the website and possible remote server will cost monthly payments, likely in the 20~40 dollar range
