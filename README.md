## Project Abstract

We aim to design an innovative web application tailored for Dungeons and Dragons game masters to assist with balancing combat encounters. This project will delve into the realms of web development, database design, and machine learning to create a robust tool that enhances the gaming experience by providing precise and dynamic combat simulations.

## Budget

So far, we haven't had to use any money on this project as our student licenses have covered any IDE's or database set up such as for the SQL Server, but we envision that the hosting of the website and possible remote server will cost monthly payments, likely in the 20~40 dollar range
