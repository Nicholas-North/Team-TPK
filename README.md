## Project Abstract

We aim to design an innovative web application tailored for Dungeons and Dragons game masters to assist with balancing combat encounters. This project will delve into the realms of web development, database design, and machine learning to create a robust tool that enhances the gaming experience by providing precise and dynamic combat simulations.

## Project Description

## User Stories

Story 1: As a person who runs a Dungeons and Dragons group, I want to see more information about combat encounters. This will help me plan my sessions easier and run my combats more smoothly. 

Story 2: As an adventure designer for commercial published material, I want to make sure the encounters I create are properly balanced and playtested to be at the set level the adventurer's are. 

Story 3: As a dungeon master, I want to be able to tweak existing monster stat blocks to make the fights more challenging, but also be able to know they aren't too stacked against the party's favor.

Story 4: As a D&D player, I want to engage in fun combat encounters and I wish there was a tool for my DM to make our current sessions more exciting.

Story 5: As a concerned parent, my child spends too much time designing complex dungeons and dragons encounters, I wish there was a tool to simplify the process, so that they can get their life back.
